# SSL Certificate Files

# Place your SSL/TLS certificate files here for HTTPS configuration

#

# For Let's Encrypt:

# Use certbot to generate certificates and place them in this directory

#

# For self-signed certificates (development only):

# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \

# -keyout /path/to/ssl/key.pem \

# -out /path/to/ssl/cert.pem
